E. coli is a type of fecal coliform bacteria that occurs naturally within the GI tracts of warm blooded animals, including humans. E. coli can enter rivers via multiple routes, which include combined sewer overflows during storm events, from failing septics, and from agricultural runoff. In Indiana, E. coli levels that exceed 235 colony-forming units per 100 ml sample of water are considered unsafe for full body contact recreation.
