## Chlorides

Chlorides measure the level of salts in water, and include sodium chloride (table salt). Chloride salts can enter our rivers and streams from multiple sources. Table salt is widely used in the production of industrial chemicals, while many other different salts are used in snow and ice control in our region. Normally waters in our region have chloride levels less than 250 mg/L; higher levels pose risks to humans and aquatic life.
