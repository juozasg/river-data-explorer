## Total suspended solids (TSS)

TSS is a measure of how many particles are floating in the water column. Examples of particles that make up TSS include sediments, silt, sand, and algae. Healthy rivers should have TSS levels below 30 mg/L; elevated TSS can impair fish by clogging their gills and altering their food and habitat.
