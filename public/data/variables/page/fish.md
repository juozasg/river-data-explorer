## Fish

The St. Joseph River and its tributaries are home to many species of fish. Biologists have been conducting fish surveys in the river since 1998, which has resulted in a rich dataset containing fish indexes of biotic integrity (IBI). The fish IBI is a score that ranges from 0 to 60, with higher scores indicating healthier fish communities.
