## How to use this site?

### Overview
This site was created by the [St. Joseph River Basin Commission](https://sjrbc.com) to share the river water data that we collected with the public. Here you can explore, visualize, analyze and download all of the currently collected data. The website can be used to learn more about the St. Joseph River, the Basin, its regions, and the variables that are being monitored. Monitoring sites can be mapped and observervations can be compared to track changes over time and to answer questions about the health of the St. Joseph River and its watershed.

### Website Navigation
The menu bar at the top of the page is used to navigate the site.	The [Home](/) and the [About](/about) pages are starting points for learning about the data and this website.	The [Regions](#) pages is contain information about sub-regions of the Basin, while the [Variables](#) pages introduce the available variables. Finally, the [Visualize](/visualize) page provides interactive tools for selecting, mapping, comparing, analyzing and downloading the regional and site timeseries variable data.

The web map has a 3D mode toggled by the "Compass" icon. At the bottom right of the map the base layers can be switched between topographical map and satellite imagery. TODO: River stem and water bodies can be highlighted by toggling the "River Outline" overlay.
